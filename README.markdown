# Tempest Ripper

This is a final challenge for our three-session "Binary Trees" elective class.

*Before* this session you should have built a binary tree with tests.

## The Challenge

Parse the text of Shakespere's "The Tempest" into a searchable binary tree where
each node holds a word and the line numbers where that word appears.
